Quiz 1

1. a = 1

2. An hash has key-value pairs. Arrays are index-based (order matters) and do not have key-value pairs.

3. arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]
	[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq => [1, 2, 3]
	but arr would still be [1, 2, 3, 3]

	[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq! => [1, 2, 3]
	but arr would be changed to [1, 2, 3]

4. Array.map does something to every member of the array and makes the result a new array. Array.select chooses certain members and does something to just those members, and makes a new array from the results.

5. To create a hash with strings for keys:
	h = {'string 1' => 0, 'string 2' => 4}

6.  x = 1
  x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"

  This would return "no way!" because "no way!" is in the true portion of the ternary operator.

7. x = 1

  3.times do
    x += 1
  end

  puts x

  x is 4.

 8.   3.times do
    		x += 1
  		end

  		puts x

  		ERROR
